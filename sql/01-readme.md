# Readme

All files are not only examples. This is working database. 

## Fill free to change

- You must fill table `users` manually
- replace `service` in `rights.sql` file with your service name
- replace data in `entity.sql` with your own
- change config data in `entity.sql`, `menu.sql` carefully
- add as many pages to `pages.sql` as you want
- add some redirects to `redirects.sql` to see what happens (redirect from /index to / is needed because of duplicate)

## [!] do not edit

- `recaptcha.sql` it contains important information for login and auth actions
- `recovery_email.sql` it contains temporary data
